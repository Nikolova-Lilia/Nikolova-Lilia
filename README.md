-  Hi there, I’m Lilia 👋

- 👀 I’m interested in developing new techologies and tools to help humanity and our planet.

- ⚡ What drives my curiosity - "If a problem can't be solve: Let's do it".

- 🌱 I’m currently working on my assignments in C.

- ✨ I am 42 Prague student, since June 2023.

- ⚡ Interesting fact: Before moving to Prague I had a career in civil engineering. That gave me opportunity to work a lot in 3D enverient and extended my visial orientation.

- 😄 To add to that, it thaught me a lot about fitting in project deadlines. Dealing with clients requirement and organising team work as a team leader of many projects.
